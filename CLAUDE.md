> Built with the AI Engineering Kit — a spec-driven workflow for your coding agent.

## AI Engineering Workflow

This project uses the AI Engineering Kit — a spec-driven workflow. Development runs in phases, each driven by a skill:

`/init → /write-spec → /architecture → /tasks → /build → /qa → /deploy`   (`/refine` & `/audit` anytime · `/dsgvo` when personal data is involved · `/e2e-tests` for critical flows · `/security-check` & `/cleanup` after `/deploy`)

- **Feature specs** live in `features/PROJ-X-name/`: `spec.md` (the contract — WHAT), `design.md` (the technical design — HOW), `tasks.md` (the ordered build plan), `qa-report.md` (the test report).
- **Acceptance Criteria** carry stable IDs (`AC-1`, `AC-2`, …). The chain is **AC → Task → Test**.
- **Project status** is tracked in `features/INDEX.md`.
- `spec.md` is **read-only during `/build`** — it is the stable contract.
- **One working language** for the whole project — the conversation *and* every document the skills write, acceptance criteria included. It is recorded under Key Conventions below.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router), TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui (copy-paste components)
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage) - optional
- **Deployment:** Vercel or Hostinger (GitHub-connected auto-deploy)
- **Validation:** Zod + react-hook-form
- **State:** React useState / Context API

## Key Conventions

- **Working language: Deutsch.** Talk to the user in Deutsch and write every project document in Deutsch — see `.claude/rules/general.md` → Working Language.
- **Feature IDs:** PROJ-1, PROJ-2, etc. (sequential)
- **Commits:** `feat(PROJ-X): description`, `fix(PROJ-X): description`
- **Single Responsibility:** One feature per folder
- **Feature branches:** you create a branch `feat/PROJ-X-name` before `/build`; work stays there through build/QA/E2E, and `/deploy` merges it into `main` to go live. `main` always stays deployable.
- **shadcn/ui first:** NEVER create custom versions of installed shadcn components
- **App shell:** navigation, layout regions, and the page pattern live in `docs/app-shell.md` and belong to the feature recorded there. Reuse those components — never add a second sidebar, header, or nav inside a feature. Changing how the shell behaves is a `/refine` on its owning feature.
- **Parallel build:** `/build` runs file-disjoint [P] tasks from `tasks.md` as isolated subagents
- **Human-in-the-loop:** All workflows have user approval checkpoints
- **Secrets / env files:** Never read, edit, or create `.env.local` (it's permission-blocked and holds your private keys). To document a variable, add a placeholder to `.env.local.example` (the one env file the agent may edit). When a real value is needed, the agent asks you in chat what to paste into `.env.local` — it never writes it itself.
- **Tests:** Unit tests co-located next to source files (`useHook.test.ts` next to `useHook.ts`), written by `/qa`. E2E tests live in `tests/`, added on demand by `/e2e-tests` for critical core journeys only.
- **Supabase environments:** The test-vs-live strategy (`local` / `two-projects` / `single` / `branching`) is chosen at `/init` and recorded in `docs/PRD.md` → Constraints. Default is **`local`** — Supabase runs in Docker while you build, then migrates to a hosted live project at `/deploy` (`supabase db push`). `.env.local` always holds **test** keys, never live. Schema changes are captured as `supabase/migrations/*.sql` and promoted to production at `/deploy`.

## How This Project Runs

Decided at `/init` and binding for every skill. Where this section and a stack pack disagree, this section wins — the pack describes the kit's default, this describes the project.

- **Supabase: one hosted project, `Environment strategy: single`.** There is no local Docker stack and no `supabase link`. The project lives in region `eu-central-1` (Frankfurt) on the Free plan. Test and live are the same instance, which is why nothing is ever seeded with throwaway data and no migration is applied "just to see".
- **Schema changes: file first, then apply.** Every change is written as `supabase/migrations/<NNNN>_<name>.sql` (four-digit, sequential) **and only then** applied to the hosted project via the Supabase MCP tool `apply_migration`, with the same name and the same SQL. The file is the record; the MCP call is how it reaches the database. A migration that has been applied is frozen — corrections come as a new file. The migration files are also what lets a reviewer reproduce the database from scratch.
- **The app is verified at `http://localhost:3000`** (`npm run dev`). There is no deployment; `/deploy` is out of scope for this project.
- **Tests never touch the database.** Vitest tests mock the Supabase client (`vi.mock('@/lib/supabase/server')`), because test == live here. Anything that genuinely needs a live round-trip is verified by hand in `/qa` and recorded there with its evidence.
- **Rate limiting is in-memory** (a module-level `Map` in the Next.js server process), not Upstash. Rationale: the project must cost nothing and must run for a reviewer without a second account. The limit is per IP *and* per account, and the trade-off (resets on restart, per-instance) is recorded in the owning feature's `design.md`.
- **External integration: the Frankfurter API** (`https://api.frankfurter.dev`, ECB reference rates, free, **no API key**). It is called server-side only, never from the browser. No other external service is used, and nothing is added that would require a paid plan or a reviewer's own credentials.
