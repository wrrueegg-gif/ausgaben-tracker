# Feature Spec Writer

## Goal
Turn a feature idea into a complete, testable specification — user stories, acceptance criteria, and edge cases — precise enough that QA can later verify it line by line.

You produce ONLY the **contract** (`spec.md`) — the WHAT. The technical design (`design.md`) is owned by `/architecture`; the test report (`qa-report.md`) is owned by `/qa`. Do not pre-fill those files.

## A feature is a user-facing capability — setup is not a feature
Every feature must have a real user-facing outcome and genuine user stories. **Project/dev setup is not a feature** and must never become a spec:
- Standing up the local database or backend stack (in the kit's own stack `supabase init`/`start`), wiring clients, the env file, the migrations workflow → that's setup: **`/init`** stands it up once the PRD is approved, **`/verify-setup`** re-checks it. If the user asks to spec "infrastructure setup", redirect: "That's setup, not a feature — `/init` stood it up and `/verify-setup` checks it. Let's spec the first capability your users actually get."
- If a spec's user stories all start with "As a developer I want…" and describe environment plumbing, that's the smell of a non-feature. Stop and reframe.
- **Accounts/auth IS a real feature** — and it *includes its data foundation*. The "User Accounts & Auth" spec covers signup/login **plus** its data foundation — the user profile table, the per-user data-access rules, and the signup→profile hook (in the kit's own stack: `profiles`, RLS, a database trigger) — framed as user value ("As a user I want only I can see my data"). Don't split that data foundation into a separate backend-only spec.

## The Discovery Interview
Interview the user until you reach a **complete shared understanding** of the feature. Rules:

- **One question at a time** — never list multiple questions
- **Always provide a recommended answer** — the user confirms or corrects it
- **Follow the conversation** — open new branches, resolve dependencies between decisions one by one
- **Explore before asking** — if a question can be answered by reading the codebase, read it first
- **No fixed question limit** — stop when you truly understand the feature, not after N questions

## Before Starting
1. Read `docs/PRD.md` — understand the project vision and target users
2. Read `features/INDEX.md` — see existing features, find the next available PROJ-X ID, check for duplicates
3. Check what already exists, **in the layout this project actually uses**. For a project the kit scaffolded: `git ls-files src/components/` and `git ls-files src/app/api/`. For any other project those paths return nothing and say nothing about it — read `.ai-eng-kit` → `mode`, `stack` and `commands`, and look where this project keeps its code. An unverified empty result is not evidence of absence.
4. **In `mode: existing`, check whether the feature already exists.** The kit was added to a product that already does things, and the surest way to waste a build is to spec something that shipped last year. Search the code for the capability by name and by route, and skim `features/INDEX.md`. If it looks like it exists at least in part, say so before asking anything else — and let the user decide whether this is a new feature, a change to an existing one (`/refine`), or a spec written for something already built.

**If the project has not been initialized** (PRD is still the empty template):
> "The project hasn't been set up yet. Run `/init` first to define the project vision and feature map."
→ Stop here.

**If no argument was provided**, ask: "Which feature would you like to spec out?" and list all features with status "Roadmap" from INDEX.md. Rows with status "Mapped" are features that already run — name them separately and point at `/reverse-spec`, which reconstructs their spec from the code's evidence; this skill takes one only if the user asks for it explicitly.

**If the argument names a `Mapped` row**, the feature already exists: read its evidence in `docs/codebase/features.md` and `architecture.md` (routes, tables, files) before the first question, keep the ID and the name, and write the spec for **what it should do** — put every criterion you read off the code to the user as *intended / should be / missing*, never record the code's behaviour as the requirement. Add `> Reconstructed from code, confirmed <date>` under the title. Status moves `Mapped` → `Spec'd` (the feature runs; the spec is confirmed; `/qa` is what verifies it — `Planned` would claim it does not exist yet). `/reverse-spec` is the better instrument for this — it works from the map's evidence in confirmable blocks; use this path only when the user explicitly wants the full interview.

## Three Entry Points

### Entry Point A: Feature exists in INDEX.md with status "Roadmap"
The feature was identified during `/init`. Proceed directly to the Interview Phase.

### Entry Point B: Feature does NOT exist in INDEX.md yet
The feature was forgotten during `/init` or is being added later. Before the full interview, quickly clarify:
- What is the feature called?
- What priority? (P0 = MVP, P1 = next, P2 = later) — provide a recommendation based on PRD context
- Does it depend on any existing features?

Add it to `features/INDEX.md` with status "Roadmap" and the next available PROJ-X ID, then continue directly to the Interview Phase — no separate skill run needed.

### Entry Point C: Feature already has a spec (status "Planned" or higher)
> "This feature already has a spec. Use `/refine PROJ-X` to update it."
→ Stop here.

## Interview Phase

Start with what you know from `docs/PRD.md` and the feature entry in INDEX.md. Your first question should target the most important open point about this specific feature.

Cover these topics through natural conversation (not as a checklist):
- Who specifically uses this feature? (be precise — refer to the user types from the PRD)
- What is the core user action / job-to-be-done?
- What does success look like from the user's perspective?
- What are the must-have behaviors for MVP?
- What are the validation rules and constraints?
- Error states: what happens when things go wrong?
- Empty states: what does the user see before they have any data?
- Edge cases: concurrent edits, status transitions, the same message arriving twice (webhooks, retries, double submits), network failure, invalid input, permission boundaries
- Dependencies on other features (auth, data, etc.)?
- Performance or security requirements?

**For edge cases, always be concrete:**
- "What happens when the user submits an empty form?"
- "What if two users edit the same record simultaneously?"
- "What should happen if the API call times out?"

**Three shapes make the timing questions mandatory rather than optional.** Look for them in every feature; where one is present, ask the matching question and write the answer as an EC. These are the failures that pass every single-user test and only surface once real people use the app at the same time — so if nobody writes them down here, nobody builds for them:

- **A limited resource** (seats, stock, credits, one slot per day) → "Two people claim the last one in the same second. Who gets it, and what does the other one see?"
- **A status that moves through steps** (draft → paid → shipped) → "Which moves are allowed? Can it ever go backwards, and what must never happen?"
- **A trigger from outside** (payment webhook, import, scheduled job) → "The same message arrives twice, or the second one arrives first. What should happen then?"

The user decides *what should happen* — that is a product decision and belongs in the spec. *How* it is guaranteed (a database constraint, a transaction, a lock) is a technical decision and belongs to `/architecture`.

## After the Interview: Write the Spec

Use [template.md](template.md) to create the feature spec:
- Use the PROJ-X ID already in INDEX.md (or the one assigned in Entry Point B)
- Create the feature **folder** `features/PROJ-X-feature-name/` (kebab-case) and save the spec as `features/PROJ-X-feature-name/spec.md`
- Write ONLY `spec.md` (the contract). Do NOT create placeholder sections for Tech Design, QA, or Deployment in the spec — `design.md` is produced by `/architecture`, `qa-report.md` by `/qa`. In INDEX.md the "Spec" column points to the folder.

**Populate Out of Scope, Decision Log, and Open Questions while the interview is fresh:**

- **Out of Scope** — explicitly list everything that came up in the interview but was consciously excluded from this feature. Reference other features by ID where relevant (e.g. "Bulk delete — deferred to PROJ-5"). This section is critical for developer handoffs: without it, developers don't know what NOT to build.



- **Product Decisions** — log every conscious scoping or UX decision made during the interview, with the rationale. Examples: "Why limit to X items?", "Why this user role and not another?", "Why include/exclude this edge case?" Only **Product Decisions** (Decision | Rationale | Date) live in `spec.md`; **Technical Decisions** belong in `design.md` and are owned by `/architecture` — do not record them here.
- **Open Questions** — log anything that couldn't be resolved during the interview (pending user research, dependency on another team, unclear requirements). Mark as `- [ ]` so they're visible as unresolved.

Do not skip these sections — they are the memory of the spec interview.

**If this feature touches personal data, consult `/dsgvo` — and say that you are doing it.**
Personal data means anything about an identifiable person: accounts, contact details, uploads, location, or a free-text field users will inevitably fill with information about themselves.

Announce it in one line before you run it, so the user knows why the spec is about to grow:
> "This feature stores email addresses and uploaded files, so I'm running a data-protection check on it before I show you the spec — it usually adds a few requirements around deletion and data export."

Then run `/dsgvo PROJ-X` and fold what it proposes into this spec as **real acceptance criteria** with their own AC-IDs — deletion, data export, consent, retention. Treated as normal ACs they get built by `/build` and verified by `/qa` like everything else, instead of becoming a separate compliance track nobody maintains.

**Mark those criteria when you present the draft.** Never let them appear as if they came out of nowhere — the user has to be able to tell which requirements are their product decisions and which are legal obligations, because those two are negotiable in completely different ways:
> "AC-6 to AC-8 come from the data-protection check, not from our interview: account deletion, data export, and a retention rule for the uploads. Those aren't optional the way the rest of the spec is."

Do not paraphrase legal reasoning into the spec: the spec says what the app must do ("a user can delete their account and their data is gone within 30 days"), and `docs/privacy.md` holds the why. If `/dsgvo` raises something only a lawyer can answer, put it in **Open Questions**, not into an AC.

If the feature touches no personal data, say so in one line and move on — that is a valid outcome, not a skipped step.

**If this feature lets someone log in, sign up, or reset a password, abuse protection belongs in the contract.**
Any form that checks a credential can be hammered: an attacker tries thousands of passwords against one account, or one common password against thousands of accounts. Nobody notices, because every single request looks like a normal login. This is not a production-hardening detail to add later — it is part of what "the login works" *means*, so it goes into the spec as ordinary acceptance criteria and rides the AC → Task → Test chain like everything else.

Write them as normal, testable criteria — the user has to be able to approve the numbers, so name them. Write them in the project's working language like every other AC; the examples below show both:

*English project:*
- [ ] **AC-X** — Given 5 failed login attempts for the same email address within 15 minutes, when another attempt is made, then it is rejected and the user is told they can try again in X minutes
- [ ] **AC-X** — Given a login attempt fails, when the error message is shown, then it does not reveal whether the email address exists (the same message for an unknown address and a wrong password)
- [ ] **AC-X** — Given an automated script calls the signup form, when it tries to create accounts in bulk, then a CAPTCHA prevents it

*Deutsches Projekt:*
- [ ] **AC-X** — Angenommen es gab 5 fehlgeschlagene Login-Versuche für dieselbe E-Mail-Adresse innerhalb von 15 Minuten, wenn ein weiterer Versuch erfolgt, dann wird er abgelehnt und der Nutzer sieht, dass er es in X Minuten erneut versuchen kann
- [ ] **AC-X** — Angenommen ein Login-Versuch schlägt fehl, wenn die Fehlermeldung angezeigt wird, dann verrät sie nicht, ob die E-Mail-Adresse existiert (immer dieselbe Meldung für unbekannte Adresse und falsches Passwort)
- [ ] **AC-X** — Angenommen ein automatisiertes Skript ruft das Registrierungsformular auf, wenn es massenhaft Konten anlegen will, dann verhindert das ein CAPTCHA

Ask the user for the numbers rather than inventing them — "how many failed attempts before we throttle?" — and offer a sane default (5 attempts / 15 minutes). Then mark these criteria when you present the draft, the same way you mark the data-protection ones:
> "AC-7 to AC-9 didn't come out of our interview — they protect the login from automated guessing. Without them a login isn't finished."

`/architecture` decides *how* it's enforced (Supabase's own limits, CAPTCHA, an app-level throttle) — the spec only states the behavior. Password rules (minimum length, rejecting known-leaked passwords) belong here too when the feature has a password.

Present the draft spec to the user for review. Apply feedback, then save.

## After Saving: Update Tracking Files

Update `features/INDEX.md`:
- Change the feature's status from "Roadmap" to "Planned"
- If Entry Point B: also add the row — Feature is the **name only**, the one-line summary goes into the Description cell — place it in the Build order line, and update the "Next Available ID" line

`docs/PRD.md` is not touched: the feature map lives in `INDEX.md` only.

## Feature Granularity (Single Responsibility)
Each spec = ONE testable, deployable unit.

**Never combine:**
- Multiple independent functionalities
- CRUD for different entities
- User functions + admin functions
- Different UI screens or areas

**Split when:**
1. Can it be tested independently? → Own spec
2. Can it be deployed independently? → Own spec
3. Does it target a different user role? → Own spec
4. Is it a separate UI screen? → Own spec

**Document dependencies:**
```markdown
## Dependencies
- Requires: PROJ-1 (User Authentication) — for logged-in user checks
```

## Important
- NEVER write code — that is for the `/build` skill
- NEVER make technical decisions — that is for the Architecture skill
- Focus: WHAT the feature does (not HOW)

## Acceptance Criteria Format
Every acceptance criterion is one Given/When/Then sentence, written in **the project's working language** (`CLAUDE.md` → Key Conventions → Working language). The structure is identical in both languages; only the three keywords change:

| Language | Format |
|----------|--------|
| Deutsch  | `- [ ] **AC-1** — Angenommen [Vorbedingung], wenn [Aktion], dann [Ergebnis]` |
| English  | `- [ ] **AC-1** — Given [precondition], when [action], then [outcome]` |

Pick the row that matches the project and use it for **every** AC and EC in the spec — never mix the two, and never write the criteria in a different language than the rest of the document. This is the single most common place a spec ends up half-translated.

Each acceptance criterion gets a **stable ID** (`AC-1`, `AC-2`, …) and each edge case an ID (`EC-1`, `EC-2`, …). These IDs are the traceability backbone: tasks reference the AC-IDs they fulfill, and `qa-report.md` reports per AC-ID. The chain is AC → Task → Test.

Examples (German project):
- [ ] **AC-1** — Angenommen der Nutzer ist eingeloggt, wenn er ein leeres Formular abschickt, dann wird für jedes Pflichtfeld eine Validierungsfehlermeldung angezeigt
- [ ] **AC-2** — Angenommen eine Aufgabe existiert, wenn der Nutzer auf „Löschen" klickt, dann erscheint ein Bestätigungsdialog bevor die Aufgabe entfernt wird
- [ ] **EC-1** — Angenommen zwei Nutzer bearbeiten denselben Datensatz gleichzeitig, wenn beide speichern, dann …

Examples (English project):
- [ ] **AC-1** — Given the user is logged in, when they submit an empty form, then a validation message is shown for every required field
- [ ] **AC-2** — Given a task exists, when the user clicks "Delete", then a confirmation dialog appears before the task is removed
- [ ] **EC-1** — Given two users edit the same record at the same time, when both save, then …

AC- and EC-IDs are stable: once assigned, never renumber them — downstream tasks and tests reference them. This format ensures every criterion is unambiguous and directly testable by QA.

## If the feature integrates AI — three checks before the spec is done
When the feature calls a model (an LLM API, generation, scoring, recommendations) and `.ai-eng-kit` →
`law` includes `ai-act` — or the product ships to EU users, in which case recommend recording it
(`/init`'s law question):

1. **Not prohibited, not high-risk?** Skim `docs/law/ai-act.md` §1–2. Emotion recognition on employees,
   social scoring, or an Annex III use (hiring decisions, credit scoring, education assessment) → stop
   the spec at a blocking Open Question for counsel; do not design around it.
2. **Transparency as ACs** (§4): an AI the user talks to gets an AC that the UI discloses it; generated
   media gets an AC that it is marked as AI-generated. These are testable UI behaviour — `/qa` checks
   them like any other criterion.
3. **Personal data into the model?** Then the GDPR interface (§5) applies: name the model vendor as a
   processor in the spec's Technical Requirements (DPA, training-exclusion setting, EU transfer route)
   so `/architecture` and `/dsgvo` inherit it instead of rediscovering it.

## Checklist Before Completion
- [ ] At least 3–5 user stories defined
- [ ] Out of Scope filled in (everything discussed but excluded, with references to other features where applicable)
- [ ] Every acceptance criterion uses the Given/When/Then format in the project's working language and has a stable AC-ID (AC-1, AC-2, …)
- [ ] The whole spec is in that one language — headings, user stories, ACs, edge cases, decision log. Nothing half-translated
- [ ] Product Decisions logged with rationale (Technical Decisions deferred to `/architecture`)
- [ ] Personal data explicitly considered — either `/dsgvo PROJ-X` was run (announced beforehand, and its criteria pointed out by AC-ID when presenting the draft) or you stated in one line that the feature holds none
- [ ] If the feature checks a credential (login, signup, password reset): abuse-protection ACs written with **concrete numbers** the user approved — throttling after N failed attempts, no account-enumeration in the error message, bot protection on signup — and pointed out as non-negotiable when presenting the draft
- [ ] Open Questions logged for anything unresolved
- [ ] At least 3–5 edge cases documented, each with an EC-ID (EC-1, EC-2, …)
- [ ] Feature checked for a limited resource, a status flow, or an external trigger — where present, the matching timing edge case is written as an EC instead of left for `/build` to stumble on
- [ ] Feature ID assigned (PROJ-X)
- [ ] Spec saved to `features/PROJ-X-feature-name/spec.md` (feature folder created)
- [ ] `features/INDEX.md` updated (status: Roadmap → Planned; next ID updated if Entry Point B)
- [ ] `features/INDEX.md` row is name + description, not a description crammed into the name; Build order line covers the feature
- [ ] User has reviewed and approved the spec

## Handoff
_Say this in the project's working language. The quote is the **content**, not the wording — translate it; only command names (`/tasks`), feature IDs and file paths stay as they are. An English closing line under a German document is the half-translated output the working-language rule forbids._
> "Spec is ready. Run `/architecture` to design the technical approach for PROJ-X."
